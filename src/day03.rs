/*
 * Part 1
 *
 * With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport.
 * While travel by toboggan might be easy, it's certainly not safe:
 * there's very minimal steering and the area is covered in trees.
 * You'll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
 *
 * Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid.
 * You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (.) and trees (#) you can see. For example:
 *
 * ..##.......
 * #...#...#..
 * .#....#..#.
 * ..#.#...#.#
 * .#...##..#.
 * ..#.##.....
 * .#.#.#....#
 * .#........#
 * #.##...#...
 * #...##....#
 * .#..#...#.#
 *
 * These aren't the only trees, though;
 * due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability,
 * the same pattern repeats to the right many times:
 *
 *
 * ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
 * #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
 * .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
 * ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
 * .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
 * ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
 * .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
 * .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
 * #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
 * #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
 * .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
 *
 * You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
 *
 * The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers);
 * start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:
 *
 * From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1.
 * Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
 *
 * The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:
 *
 * ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
 * #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
 * .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
 * ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
 * .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
 * ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
 * .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
 * .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
 * #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
 * #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
 * .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
 *
 * In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.
 *
 * Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1,
 * how many trees would you encounter?

}

/*
 * Part 2
 *
 * Time to check the rest of the slopes - you need to minimize the probability of a sudden arboreal stop, after all.
 *
 * Determine the number of trees you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes,
 * you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:
 *
 * Right 1, down 1.
 * Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
 * Right 5, down 1.
 * Right 7, down 1.
 * Right 1, down 2.
 *
 * In the above example, these slopes would find 2, 7, 3, 4, and 2 tree(s) respectively;
 * multiplied together, these produce the answer 336.
 *
 * What do you get if you multiply together the number of trees encountered on each of the listed slopes?
