I'm learning Rust. So, I have decided to have a go at Advent of Code challenges with Rust.

I'm using `cargo-aoc` as the helper.

To download inputs 

```
cargo aoc input
```

for specific days or years


```
cargo aoc input -d {day} -y {year}
```

to run for the latest day

```
cargo aoc
```

to run benchmarks for the latest day

```
cargo aoc bench
```
