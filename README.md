I'm learning Rust. So, I have decided to have a go at Advent of Code challenges with Rust.

Check out https://adventofcode.com/2020/ to read the puzzles.


I'm using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) as the helper.

To download inputs 

```sh
cargo aoc input # for the next day
cargo aoc input -d {day} # for a specific day
```

to run and get the output

```sh
cargo aoc # for the last day
cargo aoc -d {day} # for a specific day
```

to run benchmarks 

```sh
cargo aoc bench # for the last implemented day
cargo aoc bench -d {day} # for a specific day
```
